## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ bun install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Observability

In production applications, observability is essential for understanding how your system behaves, detecting issues early, and maintaining reliable performance.

[NestJS Observe](https://observe.nestjs.com) automatically instruments your NestJS application, giving you deep visibility into your system with minimal setup:

- **Distributed tracing:** Follow requests across services and understand how they flow through your system.
- **Waterfall analysis:** Visualize request execution and identify slow operations, bottlenecks, and unexpected delays.
- **Performance analysis:** Analyze application performance in real time and quickly pinpoint areas that need optimization.
- **Metrics:** Track key application and infrastructure metrics to understand system health and performance trends.
- **Logging:** Centralize and correlate logs with traces and other telemetry to make debugging easier.
- **Error tracking:** Detect errors quickly and investigate their root causes with the surrounding context.
- **SLA monitoring:** Track service-level objectives and identify when your application is approaching or exceeding defined thresholds.
- **Alarms and alerts:** Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, SLA violations, and other anomalies so your team can react quickly.
